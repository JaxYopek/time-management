# Time Management Web Page
This is a basic HTML time management web page that includes:
- A live clock
- A timer
- A stopwatch
- A countdown to a selected date and time
Everything runs in a single HTML file using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
# How to Use
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Open the [clock.html](clock.html) file in your browser
3. Use the clock, timer, stopwatch, and countdown as needed
That’s it! There’s not much else to it.
